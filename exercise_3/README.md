# Exercise 3

## Step 1: not much is happening

```shell
  $> mvn buildplan:list
```

> What does it display? Why?

## Step 2: a little change can do a lot

First: change `<packaging>pom</packaging>` to `<packaging>jar</packaging>`.
Then:

```shell
 $> mvn buildplan:list
```

> Compare this output to the previous? Why has it changed?
